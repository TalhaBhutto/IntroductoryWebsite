                <p>Web Developers are responsible for creating websites that are both functionally and aesthetically pleasing to the user. The typical work activities of a Web Developer include back-end tasks such as developing databases, writing and testing code for website functions, troubleshooting code in existing features and brainstorming new features based on user feedback. I have trained myself on these principles. My goal is to do justice with my job or whichever task I am assigned. I put all my efforts to provide best result the client.</p>
